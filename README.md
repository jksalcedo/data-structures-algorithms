# Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)

This repository contains implementations of fundamental **data structures and algorithms** in **Python**.  
Currently, it covers basic linear data structures implemented with both **arrays** and **linked lists**.

## Implemented Structures
- **List** â€“ implemented with arrays  
- **Stack** â€“ implemented with linked lists  
- **Queue** â€“ implemented with linked lists  

## Purpose
The goal of this repository is to provide simple, clear implementations of common data structures for learning and practice.  
It will be gradually expanded to include more complex data structures and algorithms.

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3** (main programming language)
